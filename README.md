# Military-Strength
For my Project I choose the data related to the ranking of military strength of the country. My null hypothesis is that there is no relationship between defense budget and total military personnel for a country. In my EDA process the correlation of the variable that I choose was not very strong, it was good to look after the scatter plot, histogram, pmf, cdf and hypothesis testing. While these variables are correlated, we cannot tell if one of them is causing another one to increase. We need more analysis to find the correlation and causation. I was able to find out there was outliers in my data set with the help of histogram. Looking at the PMF we see that the there is more chance of seeing that most of the country has the total military which less than 0.5 million. There is a greater number of countries that has a smaller number of military than the country that have high number of military personnel.
